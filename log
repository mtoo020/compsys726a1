2/4/15 5:30pm - 10pm
Set up working environment
Played around with real robots
Created base code
Created OpenGL visualisation of sonar data
Created a map without rooms

3/4/15 1:30am - 4:50am
Added laser data to the visualisation
Confirmed index of left, right, front, back sonar and laser sensors in simulation

4/4/15 2am - 4:30am
Added turning and driving methods

5/4/15 2pm - 5:20pm
Used sonar to reorientate the robot to be perpedicular with the closest wall if initially placed at an angle
Created a map with rooms

7/4/15 1:30am - 3am
Added side room, object and human detection.
Robot also now waits for a response if a pair of legs is found.

7/4/15 6:30pm - 10pm
Tested code on a real robot
Changed from using sonar to using laser when initiall orientating the robot
Found the following:
Real robot
has only 180 degrees of sonar on some robots (360 in simulation and on other robots)
yaw is from 0-2pi (0 to pi/-pi to 0 in simulation)
uses wheel spin to determine yaw
has a minimum turn speed of about 0.15 

8/4/15 6pm - 10pm
Added speech thread and speech generation method
Improved turning accuracy
Started using laser points rather than ranges
Improved room/object/human detection

14/4/15 3pm - 10pm
Robot now turns and faces room when analysing rather than doing a drive-by analysis.
Improved turning accuracy
Discovered robot names (instead of IP addresses) can be used when connecting

18/4/15 3pm - 10pm
Added wall-checking when driving a specific distance
Stopped doing a 360 degree laser scan in the beginning to find the closest wall as it's too slow. Just doing a 180 degree laser scan now. 
Improved room/hand detection
Speech thread now uses a queue for dialogue and exits gracefully

19/4/15 3pm - 10pm
Improved driving and turning

20/4/15 2:30am - 3am
Fixed driving and turning
Robot can now drive a specific distance

21/4/15 3pm - 9:20pm
Testing
Cleaned up code
Added comments

22/4/15 3:30pm - 3:50pm
Tested again and improved driving in front of a room
